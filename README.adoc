= Wadman: World of Warcraft addon manager

*Wadman* is a simple command-line tool to manage World of Warcraft addons that are
obtained from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons[CurseForge]. Addons can be
installed using their CurseForge project IDs, and will then be automatically
kept up to date whenever the `update` command is run.

== Initial configuration

Wadman will attempt to autodetect your WoW install. Simply run `wadman update`
and it will report the detected directory. If this isn't correct, or it failed
to detect your install entirely, you can edit the JSON config file (located in
`%APPDATA%\wadman\config.json` on Windows or `~/.config/wadman/config.json` on
Linux). NB: As this is a JSON key you would need to escape back slashes, so
the config will look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "install_path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\_retail_",
  // ...
}
----

== Finding project IDs

=== From CurseForge

The CurseForge website shows project IDs in the sidebar for each project.
For example looking at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods[Deadly Boss Mods]
the sidebar shows the project ID is `3358`:

=== Using Wadman

Wadman has a built-in search feature that shows you the name and IDs of matching
addons:

[source]
----
$ wadman search "deadly boss mods"
[  3358] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM)
[ 61621] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - Challenges (Visions/Torghast)
[ 61882] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - PvP Mods
[ 16442] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - BC & Vanilla mods (Retail)
[ 43971] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - Cataclysm mods
----

== Managing addons

Addons are added and removed by passing their project IDs to the `add` and `remove`
commands:

[source]
----
# Install DBM and the Cataclysm mods
$ wadman add 3358 43971

# Remove just the Catalycsm mod
$ wadman remove 43971
----

Updating addons is performed using the `update` command. You can optionally pass the
`--force` flag to force all addons to be removed and replaced with their latest versions:

[source]
----
# Update any addons with new releases
$ wadman update

# Remove and reinstall all addons
$ wadman update --force
----
