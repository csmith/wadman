= Wadman: World of Warcraft addon manager

*Wadman* is a simple command-line tool to manage World of Warcraft addons that are
obtained from https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons[CurseForge]. Addons can be
installed using their CurseForge project IDs, and will then be automatically
kept up to date whenever the `update` command is run.

== Initial configuration

(This will be changing in a future version)

To get started, run `wadman update` and a message will be displayed showing
the location of wadman's configuration file. At the start of the config file
will be an `"install_path"` key that you need to change to the path of your
World of Warcraft folder, such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\\_retail_`.
NB: As this is a JSON key you would need to escape back slashes so the config will
look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "install_path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\_retail_",
  // ...
}
----

== Finding project IDs

=== From CurseForge

The CurseForge website shows project IDs in the sidebar for each project.
For example looking at https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods[Deadly Boss Mods]
the sidebar shows the project ID is `3358`:

=== Using Wadman

Wadman has a built-in search feature that shows you the name and IDs of matching
addons:

[source]
----
$ wadman search "deadly boss mods"
[  3358] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM)
[ 61621] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - Challenges (Visions/Torghast)
[ 61882] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - PvP Mods
[ 16442] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - BC & Vanilla mods (Retail)
[ 43971] Deadly Boss Mods (DBM) - Cataclysm mods
----

== Managing addons

Addons are added and removed by passing their project IDs to the `add` and `remove`
commands:

[source]
----
# Install DBM and the Cataclysm mods
$ wadman add 3358 43971

# Remove just the Catalycsm mod
$ wadman remove 43971
----

Updating addons is performed using the `update` command. You can optionally pass the
`--force` flag to force all addons to be removed and replaced with their latest versions:

[source]
----
# Update any addons with new releases
$ wadman update

# Remove and reinstall all addons
$ wadman update --force
----
